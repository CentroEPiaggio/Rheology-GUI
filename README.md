# Rheology GUI

A graphical user interface (GUI) to optimize the printing parameters for Extrusion-Bioprinting based on the material properties, printer set-up and user inputs. The software is based on mathematical modeling of the printing process, taking into account different aspects that influence printability (i.e., if a print will be successfull or not), including:
1. Extrudability, by considering the pressure required to start flow and to extrude the material at a given flow-rate
2. Line deposition and interaction with the printing substrate
3. Print fidelity, by evaluating the deformation of the printed line and whole scaffold due to gravity

# How to install
The GUI is available as a portable application, just download the folder 'dist' from the repository.
The folder contains an executable file (tested on Windows 10), which can be used to rune the application. The 'config' folder is used to store the configurations for each tab of the application.\

**WARNING**: Do not delete/move the 'config' folder, the GUI may not work properly!

The software is also available at the following webpage: [https://rheo.herokuapp.com/](url)
